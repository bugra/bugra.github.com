            <h1>Blog in Review 2014</h1>
        </header>
        <div class='post-content'>
            <p>This blog(I guess no matter how much I do not like this term, this website
is a blog) has been around more than 3 years by now. Last year, I made a conscious
decision that I should write more regularly and removing some of the posts that
are all about rants and ideas about everything and keep the ones that are mostly
about data. I’d like to think about this blog as data-driven medium where the blog
posts should be medium to long lengths. I will also write about programming as
well, but mostly it is about data and analysis.</p>
<p>If you ask me which wh- question do you like most(you do not ask such questions,
but for the sake of argument), I’d immediately answer <strong>why</strong>. Not only
it gives reasons which I think is the fundamental block for many things presence,
but also it gives very purpose of the things and people. After you could answer 
<strong>why</strong>, everything else(what, how, which) is secondary.
Icing on the cake, if you get this wh-question right, you would not have 
existential problems.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<ol>
<li>I want to improve my writing skill. I am not a native speaker, sometimes find 
myself struggling to communicate what I have been thinking. There are many ways
to improve one’s communication and writing is essential part of the most important
communication channel that ever existed: email. Seriously, it is important.</li>
<li>I want to improve my data analysis/programming skills. Data analysis is not
what I do day to day in my job and more often than not, it is a starting point
for most of my projects in order to understand what type of data we have and
what type of questions that it could answer. If you cannot visualize/explore your
data, you would have a poor head start and that may restrict the scope of the
project. It is one thing you cannot do what is possible, and another completely
different thing you do not know what is possible. The latter is the worst.</li>
<li>To learn better about the topic and start a conversation. I wrote a blog post
<a href="http://bugra.github.io/work/notes/2014-08-23/on-machine-learning/">On Machine Learning</a>
which is about practical problems that I faced in applying machine learning to
different kinds of problems. Some people reached out to me over Twitter and some
via email and I get to learn many other problems of others that I had no idea of
existence. Most of the topics that I write about, I would say I had some prior
work but definitely not expert level. This would allow other people yell at me
over the matters that they know better than me.(which is always a good thing, you
get to write one thing and learn many. Internets is not a place where you could
maintain a meaningful conversation anyways)</li>
<li>To document what I have been learning. I started to grow an interest in Bayesian
models last year and learned quite well Monte-Carlo methods and how they can be 
applied to interesting practical problems. Right now, I am not using MCMC that much 
since my focus is now mostly information retrievals and search. But it is always 
nice to relearn the topic from your writing. Not only it makes it very easy to 
grasp, but also other things that I learned at that time comes back because of 
association.</li>
<li>Publish interesting IPython notebooks. I spent quite a lot of time IPython 
notebooks either for fun or profit. Blog becomes a place where I put IPython 
notebooks that are worth publishing.(Thanks for Pelican and IPython notebook 
plugin for enabling me to publish those notebooks)</li>
</ol>
<h3>How come?</h3>
<p>It has been around 1 year since I started this blog and I really wanted to see 
some patterns around the audience and what blog posts are more important to drive
traffic, which channels and more about my audience. Also, to see if I need to 
optimize for mobile even further(right now, it is accessible through mobile and 
good, but it is not great) I also like to think this blog’s data is a return to 
its audience and it reached a point that it generates its very own data.</p>
<h3>What did you use?</h3>
<p>Google Analytics data. It is not great but it is somehow complete and allows you to
access somehow nice csv’s to use. It also allows having different time intervals if 
you want more granular or less granular data </p>
<h4>Organic Search Results</h4>
<p>If there is one thing that I like most about the blog, that is that for some of 
the google searches, the blog appears in top 10 and sometimes top(try googling 
‘alternating least squares’) which is pretty amazing on its own, but also 
allows me to establish my authority.
