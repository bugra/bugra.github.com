            <h1>Mining a VC</h1>
        </header>
        <div class='post-content'>
            <p>Fred Wilson is one of the most popular VCs(rightly so) who is based in NY and
he has a really great <a href="http://avc.com/">blog</a>, where he talks about pretty much
anything with a focus on startups, venture capital and technology. No surprise here.</p>
<p>His <a href="http://avc.com/2003/09/my_first_post/">first post</a> dates back to 23rd September
2003. He has been blogging for more than 11 years.</p>
<h3>How come?</h3>
<p>I have started at <a href="http://www.axial.net/">Axial</a> recently and doing topic modeling
to improve our search and recommendations as well as to build some other features
that are driven by documents and text.</p>
<h3>What gives?</h3>
<p>To see some of the topics over time as his posts are somehow topical and could 
shed some light on hot industries as he also uses his blog as a reach tool for
entrepreneurs. This of course follows their investments as well, if he is writing
on a particular industry(bitcoin, mesh networks), chances are either they invested 
in some technology(bitcoin) or looking for companies(mesh networks) that they 
wanted to invest.</p>
<h3>What does a VC write anyway?</h3>
<p>Mostly Venture Capital presumably, but also introduces his portfolio companies,
tries to raise awareness of new and cool technologies(bitcoin) and talks about 
his professional and personal life. That being said, there is no quantitative measure
which topics he focuses on and how much. By measuring the topic frequency and 
variation over time, you could get a sense of which topics are actually trending as 
well. Scroll for that a bit.</p>
<h3>What did you use?</h3>
<p>All of his blog posts from start(09, 2003) to 31st December 2014(including). He writes 
a post per day and occasionally he may repeat the some of his posts 
(e.g. when he is on vacation), but other than posts should be unique and mostly 
they are medium-long length articles which is great for topic modeling. Earlier 
posts have the same date and I filter out the posts so that every date would have 
only a single post as I do not want to give biases of dates that have more than 1 
post. I also filtered out the documents that have no words in it(some of the posts 
have only images apparently, #tumblrstyle). </p>
<h3>Ok, got it. Topics, but what are they?</h3>
<p>You could think of topics as specific word groups that are high likely to occur 
together. The algorithm(LDA) makes plausible and practical assumptions in text, and 
topics end up being logically plausible word groups that you could get the what 
the gist of those documents, it may seem like a keyword extraction tool, but not
really.</p>

<p>If you quickly glance the words following the topics, you could immediately get 
a sense of <em>the topic</em>. The labels that precedes the words are the topic labels and
I came up with. Some of the topics, they may not represent the topics very accurately 
but my hope is that they abstracted most of the content so that instead of writing
20-30 words all over the place, I could refer them via topic labels.</p>
<h4>So, in total 22 Topics?</h4>
<p>I originally put wanted to have 24 topics based on visual inspection on different 
number of topics, 24 seemed to produce nice coherent topics. However, I need to 
further process the topics because of the reason explained below. Long story short,
I removed two topics based on they are not high quality. If you want more details, read
the following section, if you do not, skip it.</p>
<h4>What is the catch(tell me as if I am 5)?</h4>
<p>If there are two problems(not automated sense, otherwise not problems really) in 
topic models; one of them is naming topics automatically and the other one is 
to determine the topic numbers to begin with. There are various measures to 
evaluate topic: coherence, corpus distance to evaluate the topic “quality”. 
I only took the topics that have high coherence and low corpus 
distances topics as valid topics. One could introduce extensive stop words to improve topics in general, but I
choose to prune the invalid topics after I run. The following topic is the only one that gets pruned and you
will understand why it is low coherence and have very small distance to corpus:
time people good back make years thing work post things great day made long year past hard week big put find times world idea blog ago point end part</p>
<p>and another topic similar to the above one get filtered out due to its has low coherence and similar to corpus.</p>
<h3>Which topic is most dominant?</h3>
<p><img alt="Topic Frequency Percentage" src="/images/work/notes/2015/1/17/topic-frequency.png" title="‘Topic Frequency Percentage’" /></p>
<p><a href="/images/work/notes/2015/1/17/topic-frequency.png">Larger Image</a></p>
<p>Comments topic has also elements of community and his venture firm(USV) as well. So, it
is not very surprising. As he invests in tech companies and most of the stuff about
portfolio companies also fall in the technology(e.g. bitcoin), it is not surprising 
that the second common topic is technology. </p>
<h3>Most Representative Words, but what about posts?</h3>
<p>I could also get the most representative individual posts as every post 
is a mixture of various topics. However, this does not mean the following documents
only have a single dominant topic. It may have two or more significant topics, but
the one that is associated with is the most significant topic. Otherwise, 
<code>Burn Rate</code> topic is somehow related to <code>Valuation</code> topic as they have overlapping
works and phrases. I could also get the documents that are focused individual 
posts that are all about one topic. Here are the most representative posts for 
each topic:</p>

<h3>Topic Changes over Time</h3>
<p>I could look at the topic distribution of the documents over time in order to 
measure if topics are trending or not. However, the trend for the topics are far
more interesting as I am not necessarily interested in the topic proportions on
a daily basis but rather medium term. Luckily, there are a lot of different ways
to do trend estimation. I will use <a href="http://bit.ly/hp-filter">Hodrick-Presscott Filter</a>
in order to get the medium range trend signal. </p>
<h3>Winner Topics</h3>
<p>Some of the topics are unsurprising winner like Internet Regulation and Mobile Apps
but do you find any suprising/interesting topics?</p>
<h5>Internet Regulation</h5>
<p><img alt="Internet Regulation" src="/images/work/notes/2015/1/17/internet-regulation-topic-trend.png" title="‘Internet Regulation’" /></p>

<p>Net neurality hit some nerves right there.</p>
<h4>Mobile Apps</h4>
<p><img alt="Mobile Apps" src="/images/work/notes/2015/1/17/mobile-apps-topic-trend.png" title="‘Mobile Apps’" /></p>
<p><a href="/images/work/notes/2015/1/17/internet-regulation-topic-trend.png">Larger Image</a></p>
<p>Mobile apps do not seem to even flatten in the near future. </p>
<h4>NYC - Community</h4>
<p><img alt="NYC Community" src="/images/work/notes/2015/1/17/nyc-community-topic-trend.png" title="‘NYC Community’" /></p>
<p><a href="/images/work/notes/2015/1/17/nyc-community-topic-trend.png">Larger Image</a></p>
<p>Making money is good, but so is community.</p>
<h4>Technology</h4>
<p><img alt="Technology" src="/images/work/notes/2015/1/17/technology-topic-trend.png" title="‘Technology’" /></p>

<p>Even though he says he does not invest in technology but networks or the things
that technology enables, apparently he cannot seems to write anything but 
technology.</p>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<p><img alt="Comments" src="/images/work/notes/2015/1/17/comments-topic-trend.png" title="‘Comments’" /></p>

<p>This topic is one of the most surprising topic, yes USV invested in Disqus, they
care a lot about community, audience but it feels to me it shouldn’t be this much,
but apparently comments topic is big.</p>
<h3>Loser Topics</h3>
<p>News, Email and Live Music are the obvious losers. Politics is big one as well.</p>
<h4>Email</h4>
<p><img alt="Email" src="/images/work/notes/2015/1/17/email-topic-trend.png" title="‘Email’" /></p>

<p>Email is not fun anymore, not even fun to complain about. So 2000.</p>
