            <h1>Mining a VC</h1>
        </header>
        <div class='post-content'>
            <p>Fred Wilson is one of the most popular VCs(rightly so) who is based in NY and
he has a really great <a href="http://avc.com/">blog</a>, where he talks about pretty much
anything with a focus on startups, venture capital and technology. No surprise here.</p>
<p>His <a href="http://avc.com/2003/09/my_first_post/">first post</a> dates back to 23rd September
2003. He has been blogging for more than 11 years.</p>
<h3>How come?</h3>
<p>I have started at <a href="http://www.axial.net/">Axial</a> recently and doing topic modeling
to improve our search and recommendations as well as to improve some other parts </p>
<h3>What gives?</h3>
<p>To see some of the topics over time as he was expressing constantly </p>
<h3>What does a VC write anyway?</h3>
<p>Mostly Venture Capital presumably, but also introduces his portfolio companies,
tries to raise awareness of new and cool technologies(bitcoin) and talks about 
his professional and personal life. But you cannot be sure until you read all 
of his blog posts, even then you would have a <em>coarse</em> idea on the quantitive 
part and this blog post mainly aims to give a more accurate/unbiased opinion
on what he actually talks about his blog posts.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>All of his blog posts from start to 31st December 2014(including). He writes 
a post per day and occasionally he repeats the same post (when he is on vacation), but
other than posts should be unique and mostly they are medium-long length articles 
which is great for topic modeling. Earlier posts have the same date and I filter
out the posts so that every date would have only a single post as I do not want 
to give biases of dates that have more than 1 post. Long story short, I have 6504 
posts in my hand. I also filtered out the documents that have no words in it(some of 
the posts could have images apparently, #tumblrstyle). </p>
<h3>Topics, but what are they?</h3>
<p>You could think of topics as specific word groups that are high likely to occur together. The algorithm(LDA) 
makes plausible and practical assumptions in text, and topics end up being logically plausible word groups
that you could get the what the gist of those documents, it may seem like a keyword extraction tool, but not
really.</p>

<h4>So, in total 22 Topics?</h4>
<p>I originally put wanted to have 24 topics based on visual inspection on different number of topics, 24 seemed
to produce nice coherent topics. However, I need to further process the topics because of the reason explained 
below.</p>
<h4>What is the catch(tell me as if I am 5)?</h4>
<p>If there are two problems(not automated sense, otherwise not problems really) in topic models; 
one of them is naming topics automatically and the other one is 
to determine the topic numbers to begin with. There are various measures to evaulate topic: coherence, corpus 
distance to evaluate the topic “quality”. I only took the topics that have high coherence and low corpus 
distances topics as valid topics. One could introduce extensive stop words to improve topics in general, but I
choose to prune the invalid topics after I run. The following topic is the only one that gets pruned and you
will understand why it is low coherence and have very small distance to corpus:
time people good back make years thing work post things great day made long year past hard week big put find times world idea blog ago point end part</p>
<p>and another topic similar to the above one get filtered out due to its has low coherence and similar to corpus.</p>
<h3>Which topic is most dominant?</h3>
<p><img alt="Topic Frequency Percentage" src="/images/work/notes/2015/1/12/topic-frequency.png" title="‘Topic Frequency Percentage’" /></p>
<p><a href="/images/work/notes/2015/1/12/topic-frequency.png">Larger Image</a></p>
<p>Comments topic has also elements of community and his venture firm(USV) as well. So, it
is not very surprising. As he invests in tech companies and most of the stuff about
portfolio companies also fall in the technology(e.g. bitcoin), it is not surprising 
that the second common topic is technology.</p>
<h3>Most Representative Words, but what about posts?</h3>
<p>Glad, you asked. I could also get the most representative individual posts as every post 
is a mixture of various topics. <code>Burn Rate</code> topic is related to <code>Valuation</code>.
I could also get the documents that are focused individual posts that are all about one
topic.</p>
