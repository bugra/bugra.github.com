<p>For almost more than one month, we have been working in a distributed manner(I do not like the term remote). This was a new environment for us as most of other companies and learned few things along the way and in this post, I want to share some of these learnings.</p>
<h3 id="health-safety">Health &amp; Safety</h3>
<p>It goes without saying that the most important thing is to communicate to your team that they need to be healthy and safe. This is a number one priority.</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow news about the pandemic situation to be informed for what comes next</li>
<li>Follow WHO and CDC recommendations</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<p>No longer those chitchats in the kitchen are happening, no longer you can sense and understand mood of people just “showing up at work”. No longer you can do check-ins on certain meetings outcomes with people through debriefs. This can increase frustration and can feel at times being isolated or “out of the loop”. However, this also is a good opportunity for everyone to double down on communication to mitigate some of these issues and increase the feeling of “being in the loop” for you and your team.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make your team feel connected</strong>
<ul>
<li>Relay more and more information to your team to get them involved as well as making them part of the team</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Be available</strong>
<ul>
<li>We have now greats tools like Slack, Zoom. If this fails, good old phone still works for every other purpose</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Prefer written communication over 1-1 video Communication</strong>
<ul>
<li>Everyone in the team can have access to information if the information is captured in the written form.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Increase the check-in frequency with your team</strong></li>
<li><strong>Have your team to inform their manager about their wellbeing and safety</strong></li>
<li><strong>Have verbal communication when necessary</strong>
<ul>
<li>Zoom is great for certain items that you cannot communicate in a written form or get closure.</li>
<li>Have also vide option in zoom whenever you can</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Be clear and strive for clarity</strong>
<ul>
<li>Without in person communication, there will be miscommunication. Be open to it and try to resolve conflicts with this in mind.</li>
<li>Overcommunicate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Be explicit and ask clarifying questions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Confirm your understanding through follow-up questions</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Be flexible</strong>
<ul>
<li>Have your own schedule and accept the same flexibility for other people.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="work">Work</h3>
<p>Many websites are experiencing high traffic and usage, make sure you have enough hardware to support a smooth customer experience. Customers need us the most in these times, we should make sure that every system is purring.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coordinate deployments as and done in a synchronized manner to deliver high quality releases</strong></li>
<li><strong>Review your on-call rotation and make necessary adjustments with people’s schedules</strong></li>
<li><strong>Run various different playbooks for different failure scenarios and make sure that your system and your team is ready to respond to incidents</strong>
<ul>
<li>Dry runs would be especially important and comes in handy for preparation</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Have a contingency plan on how you can support the systems in case if some of the team members become sick</strong></li>
<li><strong>Make sure your team have internet connection and the tools that they need to do their job effectively</strong></li>
<li><strong>Be rigorous for changes in production and have virtual war-rooms</strong></li>
</ul>
