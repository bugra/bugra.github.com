<p>For almost more than one month, we have been working in a distributed manner(I do not like the term remote). This was a new environment for us as most of other companies and learned few things along the way and in this post, I want to share some of these learnings.</p>
<h4 id="health">Health</h4>
<p>It goes without saying that the most important thing is to communicate to your team that they need to be healthy and safe. This is a number one priority.</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow local and state news about the pandemic situation to be informed for what comes next</li>
<li>Follow WHO and CDC recommendations to limit risks for you and your family</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="communication">Communication</h4>
<p>No longer those chitchats in the kitchen are happening, no longer you can sense and understand mood of people just “showing up at work”. No longer you can do check-ins on certain meetings outcomes with people through debriefs. This can increase frustration and can feel at times being isolated or “out of the loop”. However, this also is a good opportunity for everyone to double down on communication to mitigate some of these issues and increase the feeling of “being in the loop” for you and your team.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make your team feel connected
<ul>
<li>Relay more and more information to your team to get them involved as well as making them part of the team</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be available.
<ul>
<li>We have now greats tools like Slack, Zoom. If this fails, good old phone still works for every other purpose</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prefer written communication over 1-1 video Communication
<ul>
<li>Everyone in the team can have access to information if the information is captured in the written form.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Increase the check-in frequency with your team</li>
<li>Have your team to inform their manager about their wellbeing and safety</li>
<li>Have verbal communication when necessary. Zoom is great for certain items that you cannot communicate in a written form or get closure.
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>Have also vide option whenever you can</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be clear and strive for clarity.
<ul>
<li>Without in person communication, there will be miscommunication. Be open to it and try to resolve conflicts with this in mind.</li>
<li>Overcommunicate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be flexible
<ul>
<li>Have your own schedule and accept the same flexibility for other people.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="work">Work</h4>
<p>Many websites are experiencing high traffic and usage, make sure you have enough hardware to support a smooth customer experience. Customers need us the most in these times, we should make sure that every system is purring. - Coordinate deployments as and done in a synchronized manner to deliver high quality releases - Review your on-call rotation and make necessary adjustments with people’s schedules - Run various different playbooks for different failure scenarios and make sure that your system and your team is ready to respond to incidents - Dry runs would be especially important and comes in handy for preparation - Have a contingency plan on how you can support the systems in case if some of the team members become sick - Make sure your team have internet connection and the tools that they need to do their job effectively - Be rigorous for changes in production and have virtual war-rooms for large changes to make the communication smooth</p>
<p>I trust us that we will continue to deliver for our customers when they need us the most. This will be a result of heightened sense of what matters, intolerance of busy/mundane work and not people working extra hours. Let’s default to trust in each other and be flexible and accept others being flexible. We are all in this together and we can do it together.</p>
