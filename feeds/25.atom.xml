is a blog) has been around more than 3 years by now. Last year, I made a conscious
decision that I should write more regularly and removing some of the posts that
are all about rants and ideas about everything and keep the ones that are mostly
about data. I’d like to think about this blog as data-driven medium where the blog
posts should be medium to long lengths. I will also write about programming as
well, but mostly it is about data and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ask me which wh- question do you like most(you do not ask such questions,
but for the sake of argument), I’d immediately answer &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt;. Not only
it gives reasons which I think is the fundamental block for many things presence,
but also it gives very purpose of the things and people. After you could answer 
&lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt;, everything else(what, how, which) is secondary.
Icing on the cake, if you get this wh-question right, you would not have 
existential problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to improve my writing skill. I am not a native speaker, sometimes find 
myself struggling to communicate what I have been thinking. There are many ways
to improve one’s communication and writing is essential part of the most important
communication channel that ever existed: email. Seriously, it is important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to improve my data analysis/programming skills. Data analysis is not
what I do day to day in my job and more often than not, it is a starting point
for most of my projects in order to understand what type of data we have and
what type of questions that it could answer. If you cannot visualize/explore your
data, you would have a poor head start and that may restrict the scope of the
project. It is one thing you cannot do what is possible, and another completely
different thing you do not know what is possible. The latter is the worst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To learn better about the topic and start a conversation. I wrote a blog post
&lt;a href="http://bugra.github.io/work/notes/2014-08-23/on-machine-learning/"&gt;On Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt;
which is about practical problems that I faced in applying machine learning to
different kinds of problems. Some people reached out to me over Twitter and some
via email and I get to learn many other problems of others that I had no idea of
existence. Most of the topics that I write about, I would say I had some prior
work but definitely not expert level. This would allow other people yell at me
over the matters that they know better than me.(which is always a good thing, you
get to write one thing and learn many. Internets is not a place where you could
maintain a meaningful conversation anyways)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To document what I have been learning. I started to grow an interest in Bayesian
models last year and learned quite well Monte-Carlo methods and how they can be 
applied to interesting practical problems. Right now, I am not using MCMC that much 
since my focus is now mostly information retrievals and search. But it is always 
nice to relearn the topic from your writing. Not only it makes it very easy to 
grasp, but also other things that I learned at that time comes back because of 
association.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish interesting IPython notebooks. I spent quite a lot of time IPython 
notebooks either for fun or profit. Blog becomes a place where I put IPython 
notebooks that are worth publishing.(Thanks for Pelican and IPython notebook 
plugin for enabling me to publish those notebooks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How come?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been around 1 year since I started this blog and I really wanted to see 
some patterns around the audience and what blog posts are more important to drive
traffic, which channels and more about my audience. Also, to see if I need to 
optimize for mobile even further(right now, it is accessible through mobile and 
good, but it is not great) I also like to think this blog’s data is a return to 
its audience and it reached a point that it generates its very own data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What did you use?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Analytics data. It is not great but it is somehow complete and allows you to
access somehow nice csv’s to use. It also allows having different time intervals if 
you want more granular or less granular data &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Organic Search Results&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is one thing that I like most about the blog, that is that for some of 
the google searches, the blog appears in top 10 and sometimes top(try googling 
‘alternating least squares’) which is pretty amazing on its own, but also 
allows me to establish my authority on a certain topic. 
Second, if you think most of the mediums that drive traffic(hacker news, twitter and
facebook), they are mostly seasonal and ephemeral. They create huge spikes in your 
traffic but that traffic does not persist over time. Search results do persist, 
as long as people are clicking on my links when they tpye a query and stay for a long 
time, which means they are happy, search engine keeps showing that link in order
to make sure that the engagement is increasing.

&lt;p&gt;I started to write regularly at the end of the January, so this graph is pretty 
amazing to me, growth is in the right direction. The absolute number of sessions 
is low albeit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Type of Devices&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that most of the devices are actually desktop computer, but I did not know
that it is less than 20%. Tablet’s percentage is not good either.
![Type of Devices](/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/sessions_by_device_category.png ‘Type of Device Types’)
&lt;a href="/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/sessions_by_device_category.png"&gt;Larger Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desktop is still dominates in the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Session Numbers of Blog Pages&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It follows Zipf’s law as not all posts are created equal. In 2015, I want to change
this unequal distribution into a more uniform one. Equality for posts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Session Numbers](/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/session_number_of_blog_landing_pages.png ‘Session Numbers’)

&lt;h4&gt;Session Duration of Blog Pages&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them are clearly outliers as one cannot &lt;strong&gt;simply&lt;/strong&gt; spend 40 minutes but I 
blame Google Analytics for those types of mistakes. Here is another Zipf’s Law Graph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Session Duration](/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/session_duration_of_blog_landing_pages.png ‘Session Duration’)
&lt;a href="/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/session_duration_of_blog_landing_pages.png"&gt;Larger Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Average Session Duration by Referrals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Linkedin users read more than other referrals or they refer posts that
are longer than others. I’d like to think the latter as one of the somehow longer 
post is shared in Linkedin quite heavily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Session Duration of Network Referrals](/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/average_session_duration_of_network_referrals.png ‘Session Duration of Network Referrals’)

&lt;p&gt;Hacker news reader seems to just skimm the post rather than taking time to read it.
If you think my two posts that become in the first page of HN are quite long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Average Session over Months&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average session duration should show where post gets a lot of love, in this case
it is still &lt;a href="http://bugra.github.io/work/notes/2014-08-23/on-machine-learning/"&gt;On Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt;
As most of my metrics is spiked around on September, it is mostly due to that post
which get a lot love from HN, Linkedin and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Blog Users Flow&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy with most of the data that Google Analytics provide and this section 
is not one of them. They would just allow a weird screenshot of the users flow in
the website and does not give any raw data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Blog Users Flow](/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/blog-users-flow.png ‘Blog User’s Flow’)
&lt;a href="/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/blog-users-flow.png"&gt;Larger Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of drop offs when they hit the website and I guess I need to provide
better tools to expose other content in the website. It seems Disqus does not do
a good job in terms of recommending the relevant content in the bottom of every
blog posts. Also, there is no available option to go from one post to another, you
could only go back to home page and then go to the another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Session Numbers by Channel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I want to look at the channels in terms of the traffic they bring, there is not
a lot of surprise, except the confusion that Google Analytics causes. I have no
idea what “Other” or “Direct” means in the below graph, but I am putting to stress
on how important the social media for my blog is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Session Numbers by Channel](/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/channel_by_session.png ‘Session Numbers by Channel’)
&lt;a href="/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/channel_by_session.png"&gt;Larger Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Session Numbers over Month&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I want to see how much HN drives traffic to my website, I just need to visualize
the number of sessions over month; and the peaks are when my blog post makes it
to front page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Session Numbers over Months](/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/n_session_per_month.png ‘Session Numbers over Month’)
&lt;a href="/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/n_session_per_month.png"&gt;Larger Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Number of Unique Users over Month&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, number of unique users also follow session numbers over the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Number of Unique Users over Months](/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/n_session_per_month.png ‘Number of Unique Users over Month’)
&lt;a href="/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/n_session_per_month.png"&gt;Larger Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Number of Session by Network Referrals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I actually want to learn which social network actually drives most of the traffic,
it is definitely Hacker News(HN). If you do not know know about HN, it is a community
curated links and provides a nice way to discuss the content of the links, very 
similar to Reddit in many aspects, but its audience is mostly technology savy people.
They do not disclose the number of visitors or other audience metrics, but when 
your website becomes the first page for 3-4 hours, it guarantees 10K users in a very
small period of time. As I mentioned earlier, two of my posts made it to front page
and that was more than enough to make HN the first among many other social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Number of Session by Network Referrals](/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/number_of_sessions_of_network_referrals.png ‘Number of Sessions by Network Referrals’)
&lt;a href="/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/number_of_sessions_of_network_referrals.png"&gt;Larger Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pageviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the pageviews grouped by different aspects of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pageviews of Network Referrals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pageviews of network referrals closely follows the number of session with couple of
small twists, Twitter users are apparently more exploring more on the website and
HN users only consume what they come for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Pageviews by Network Referrals](/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/page_views_of_network_referrals.png ‘Pageviews by Network Referrals’)

&lt;h4&gt;Pageviews/Session of Network Referrals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which social network user does most of the page views per session?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Pageviews by Network Referrals](/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/page_views_of_network_referrals.png ‘Pageviews by Network Referrals’)
&lt;a href="/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/page_views_of_network_referrals.png"&gt;Larger Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, one Linkedin user comes, she sees another page as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Percentage of New Sessions/total Sessions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Percentage of new sessions follow total number of sessions loosely. When new peak
appears, then the new sessions peaks as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Percentage of New Sessions/Total Sessions](/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/percentage_new_sessions_vs_sessions.png ‘Percentage of New Sessions over Total Sesssions’)
&lt;a href="/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/percentage_new_sessions_vs_sessions.png"&gt;Larger Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Percentage of Sessions By Browser&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome is the most dominant and Firefox is the second, no surprise here. However,
I was not expecting Safari and its position in the list. IE does not have much 
weight, which I am glad, as I do not have an environment to test IE.(which is pretty
great excuse)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Percentage of Sessions by Browser](/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/percentage_of_sessions_by_browser.png ‘Percentage of Sessions by Browser’)
&lt;a href="/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/percentage_of_sessions_by_browser.png"&gt;Larger Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Percentage of Sessions by Device Brand&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple products get the top 2 and there are couple of Goole Nexuses and Samsungs in
the top 20, and then the remaining ones are your long tail(mostly Samsungs and
other Android OEMs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;First 20&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![First 20 Mobile Brands](/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/percentage_of_sessions_by_device_brand_first_20.png ‘Top 20 Mobile Brands’)
&lt;a href="/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/percentage_of_sessions_by_device_brand_first_20.png"&gt;Larger Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Remaining 80&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Remaining 80 Mobile Brands](/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/percentage_of_sessions_by_device_brand_from_20_to_100.png ‘Remaining 80 Mobile Brands’)

&lt;p&gt;Samsung seems to be quite dominant from a very small sample size. However, sum of
Apple products is more than sum of Android phones and other phones(there are few
Microsoft phones)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Distribution of Users by Country&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English speaking countries have the head start in this one, and they do not 
disappoint. Even though UK and Canada is small countries by population comparing 
to Germany and France, they are leading in terms of users. I’d expect more users
from China and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Users by Country](/images/work/notes/2015/1/25/percentage_of_sessions_by_location.png ‘Users by country’)

&lt;h4&gt;Distribution of Operating Systems of Users&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows is the leading OS, which surprised me as the IE gets very small share from
browser share. Apparently, Google succeeded to convince Windows users Chrome is 
better than their favorite browser.&lt;/p&gt;
